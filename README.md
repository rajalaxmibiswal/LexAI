## Overview

This project automates legal and regulatory compliance auditing using Generative AI. It analyzes uploaded legal documents, compares them against compliance frameworks such as GDPR, DPDP, and ISO 27001, identifies missing controls, evaluates risk levels, and generates professional audit reports with actionable recommendations.

## Business Problem

Organizations must comply with multiple legal and security regulations to protect sensitive information and avoid penalties.

Traditional compliance audits are often:

* Time-consuming and expensive
* Dependent on legal experts
* Prone to human error
* Difficult to scale for large document repositories
* Challenging to maintain with constantly changing regulations

This project addresses these challenges through AI-powered automation.
